## Assignment1 Membership Protocol

### Introduction

<p align="justify">

This is the first in a series of labs in which you'll build a fault-tolerant key/value storage system. In this lab
you'll implement Raft, a replicated state machine protocol. In the next lab you'll build a key/value service on top of
Raft. Then you will “shard” your service over multiple replicated state machines for higher performance.
